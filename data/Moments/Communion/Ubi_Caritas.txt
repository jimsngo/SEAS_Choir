Ubi Caritas

[Author]

[Verses 1]
The love of Christ joins us together.
Let us rejoice in him,
and in our love and care for all
now love God in return.

[Verse 2]
In true communion let us gather.
May all divisions cease
and in their place be Christ the Lord,
our risen Prince of Peace.

[Verse 3]
May we who gather at this table
to share the bread of life
become a sacrament of love,
your healing touch, O Christ.

[Verse 4]
For those in need make us your mercy,
for those oppressed, your might.
Make us, your Church, a holy sign
of justice and new life.

[Verse 5]
May we one day behold your glory
and see you face to face,
rejoicing with the saints of God
to sing eternal praise.
