Psalm 119

[Author]
Francesca LaRosa

[Refrain]
Blessed are they who follow the law of the Lord!

[Verse 1]
Blessed are they whose way is blameless,
who walk in the law of the LORD.
Blessed are they who observe his decrees,
who seek him with all their heart.

[Verse 2]
You have commanded that your precepts
be diligently kept.
Oh, that I might be firm in the ways
of keeping your statutes!

[Verse 3]
Be good to your servant, that I may live
and keep your words.
Open my eyes, that I may consider
the wonders of your law.

[Verse 4]
Instruct me, O LORD, in the way of your statutes,
that I may exactly observe them.
Give me discernment, that I may observe your law
and keep it with all my heart.
