Blessed Are You (Psalm 146)

[Author]
SUNO/Jim Ngo

[Verse 1]
Come, you weary, find your rest,
Here the broken, truly blessed.
Lay your burdens, take His peace,
In His love, sorrows cease.

[Verse 2]
Hearts that mourn, do not fear,
God will hold each falling tear.
At this table, all are fed,
Hope and comfort gently spread.

[Refrain]
Blessed are you, poor in spirit,
Heaven’s promise, shining bright.
Blessed are you, poor in spirit,
God will comfort, bring you light.

[Verse 3]
Humble hearts, God will raise,
Precious always in His gaze.
Here together, side by side,
In His kingdom we abide.

[Refrain]
Blessed are you, poor in spirit,
Heaven’s promise, shining bright.
Blessed are you, poor in spirit,
God will comfort, bring you light.

[Bridge]
Light of heaven, shining bright,
Guides us through the darkest night.
In His promise, we remain,
Love unending, hope sustained.

[Refrain]
Blessed are you, poor in spirit,
Heaven’s promise, shining bright.
Blessed are you, poor in spirit,
God will comfort, bring you light.

[Outro]
Blessed are the poor in spirit;
The kingdom of heaven is theirs!
