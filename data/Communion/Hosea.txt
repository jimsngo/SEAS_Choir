Hosea

[Author]Weston Priory/Gregory Norbet

[Verse 1]
Come back to me with all your heart.Don’t let fear keep us apart.Trees do bend, though straight and tall;so must we to others’ call.[Refrain]Long have I waited for your coming home to meand living deeply our new life.[Verse 2]
The wilderness will lead you to your heart where I will speak.Integrity and justicewith tenderness you shall know.[Verse 3]
You shall sleep secure with peace;faithfulness will be your joy.
