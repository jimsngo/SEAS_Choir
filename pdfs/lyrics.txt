In Every Age
Jan√®t Sullivan Whitaker
[Verse 1]
Long before the mountains came to be and the land and sea and stars of the night; through the endless seasons of all time, you have always been, you will always be.
[Refrain]
In ev'ry age, O God, you have been our refuge. In ev'ry age, O God, you have been our hope.
[Verse 2]
Destiny is cast, and at your silent word; we return to dust and scatter to the wind. A thousand years are like a single moment gone, as the light that fades at the end of day.
[Verse 3]
Teach us to make use of the time we have. Teach us to be patient even as we wait. Teach us to embrace our ev'ry joy and pain. To sleep peacefully, and to rise up strong.

As a mother gathers her young beneath her care, gather me into your arms.
