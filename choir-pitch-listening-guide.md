# Choir Practice Focus: Pitch Accuracy & Listening Awareness

## 1. Pitch Accuracy

- **Daily Matching:** Play random notes on a piano, keyboard app, or online tool. Sing them back, matching the pitch as closely as possible.
- **Interval Practice:** Sing simple intervals (thirds, fifths, octaves) from any starting note to train your ear for distance between notes.

## 2. Listening Awareness

- **Active Listening:** When singing with others (in rehearsal or with recordings), intentionally listen to the voices around you—not just your own.
- **Blend & Adjust:** Adjust your volume, pitch, and vowel shape to match and blend with the group or section leader. Aim for unified sound, not standing out.

*Focused, consistent practice on these two skills will strengthen both your individual musicianship and your choir’s blend!*
