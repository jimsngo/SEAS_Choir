## Quick Tips for Use
- **Position mics away from speakers** to prevent feedback
- **Test mic levels** before singers start
- **Keep music volume lower** than vocal levels initially
- **Adjust reverb per singer's preference** (some like more, some less)
- **Use the mute buttons** between songs to prevent feedback

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Feedback squealing**: Lower mic levels, move mics away from speakers, check feedback suppression is ON
- **Vocals too quiet**: Increase Channel 1&2 levels, check ToneMatch preset is set to "Vocal"
- **Music too loud**: Lower Channel 3 level
- **Effects not working**: Make sure you're pressing the channel button first, then the effect button
