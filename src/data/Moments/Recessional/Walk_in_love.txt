Walk in Love

[Verse 1]
Walk in love, hand in hand,  
Every heart, every friend.  
No walls between, no lines to defend,  
One family, without end.

[Chorus]
Walk in love, let us walk in love,  
Peace our song, kindness guide.  
Walk in love, let us walk in love, 
Hope will light every stride.  

[Verse 2]
See the light in every face,  
Different, yet bound by grace.  
No fear divides, no hate remains,  
We lift each other through pain.

[Chorus]
Walk in love, let us walk in love,  
Peace our song, kindness guide.  
Walk in love, let us walk in love, 
Hope will light every stride. 

[Bridge]
Love one another, as I loved you  
Let justice roll like a river 
Mercy flows, justice streams,  
Love our story, peace our theme.

[Chorus X2]
Walk in love, let us walk in love,
Peace our song, kindness guide.  
Walk in love, let us walk in love,  
Hope will light every stride.
