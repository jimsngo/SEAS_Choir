Drawn to You

[Refrain]
Drawn to you, Lord, we are drawn to you, 
to the beauty of your presence in this place.
Here for you, God, we are here for you 
as the gifts we bring become a feast of grace. 
We are drawn to you. 

[Verse 1]
Drawn by the love that you have poured on us, 
we bring these gifts, works of our hands.
You gather all we offer to yourself, 
receive our prayer. 

[Verse 2]
Drawn by the faith that you accept our gifts, 
and sanctify what we have shared.
To make us holy by this bread and wine, 
receive our prayer. 

[Verse 3]
Drawn by the table you have laid for us, 
the welcome feast your heart prepares, 
the words now spoken that will make us one,
receive our prayer.
