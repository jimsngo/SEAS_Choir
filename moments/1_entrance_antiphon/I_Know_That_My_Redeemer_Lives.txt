I Know That My Redeemer Lives
Scott Soper
[Verse 1]
I know that my Redeemer lives, the One who calls me home. I long to see God face to face, to see with my own eyes.
[Refrain]
I know that my Redeemer lives, that I shall rise again.
[Verse 2]
I know that I shall one day see the goodness of the Lord, when God will wipe away our tears, and death will be no more.
[Verse 3]
The last day I shall rise again, shall be remade like God. My home shall be by God's own side, the dying, rising Lord.
