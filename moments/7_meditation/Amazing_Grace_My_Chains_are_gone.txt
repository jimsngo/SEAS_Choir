Amazing Grace My Chains Are Gone
John Newton, Chris Tomlin, and Louie Giglio
[Verse 1]
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now am found, was blind but now I see.
[Refrain]
My chains are gone. I've been set free, my God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood, his mercy rains, unending love, amazing grace.
[Verse 2]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved; How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed!
[Refrain]
My chains are gone. I've been set free, my God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood, his mercy rains, unending love, amazing grace.
[Verse 3]
The Lord has promised good to me, his word my hope secures; He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures.
[Refrain]
My chains are gone. I've been set free, my God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood, his mercy rains, unending love, amazing grace.
