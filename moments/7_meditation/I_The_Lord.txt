I, the Lord
Tom Kendzia
[Refrain]
I, the Lord, am with you, always by your side. Come and take my hand, for I will lead you home. Follow me, follow me. Follow me, follow me.
[Verse 1]
I am the resurrection, and I am the life; if you believe in me, you shall live forever.
[Verse 2]
You shall have new life and live it to the full. Turn your sorrow into joy, for life has just begun.
