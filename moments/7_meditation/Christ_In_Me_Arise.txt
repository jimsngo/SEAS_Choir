Christ in Me Arise
Trevor Thomson
[Refrain]
Christ in me arise and dispel all the darkness. Christ in me arise with your power and your strength. Christ in me pour out your blessing and healing. Christ in me arise and I shall rise with you.
[Verse 1]
Be now my vision; open these eyes, showing me all that I must see. Onward to the kingdom, you are the way. Arise in me and I shall rise with you.
[Verse 2]
Be now my footsteps, leading the way, taking me where I must go. Onward to the kingdom, you are the way. Arise in me and I shall rise with you.
[Bridge]
You know my heart and you know my ways, you who formed me in my mother's womb. I live and move in you, my whole being thrives in you.
[Final Refrain]
Christ in me arise and dispel all the darkness. Christ in me arise with your power and your strength. Christ in me pour out your blessing and healing. Christ in me arise and I shall rise with you. Christ in me arise, Christ in me arise, Christ in me arise and I shall rise with you.
