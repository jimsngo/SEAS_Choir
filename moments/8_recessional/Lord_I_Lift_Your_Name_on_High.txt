Lord, I lift Your name on high
Rick Doyle Founds
[Verse 1]
Lord, I lift Your name on high; Lord, I love to sing Your praises; I'm so glad You're in my life; I'm so glad You came to save us.
[Refrain]
You came from heaven to earth to show the way; From the earth to the cross my debt to pay; From the cross to the grave; From the grave to the sky; Lord, I lift Your name on high.
[Verse 2]
Lord, I lift Your name on high; Lord of wonder and salvation. With one voice we magnify. God pf every generation.
[Refrain]
You came from heaven to earth to show the way; From the earth to the cross my debt to pay; From the cross to the grave; From the grave to the sky; Lord, I lift Your name on high.
