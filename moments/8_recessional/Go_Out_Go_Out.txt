Go Out, Go Out
Curtis Stephan
[Refrain]
Go out, go out to all the world and tell the Good News. Tell the Good... Good News!
[Verse 1]
Praise the LORD, praise the LORD, all you nations! Glorify him, glorify him, you peoples!
[Verse 2]
Steadfast, steadfast is his kindness toward us, and the faithfulness of the LORD endures!
