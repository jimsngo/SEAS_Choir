Forever
Chris Tomlin
[Verse 1]
Give thanks to the Lord, our God and King; his love endures forever. For he is good, he is above all things; his love endures forever; Sing praise, sing praise!
[Verse 2]
With a mighty hand and outstretched arm; his love endures forever. For the life that's been reborn; his love endures forever. Sing praise, sing praise! Sing praise, sing praise!
[Refrain]
Forever God is faithful; Forever God is strong; Forever God is with us; Forever!
[Verse 3]
From the rising to the setting sun; his love endures forever. And by the grace of God we will carry on; his love endures forever. Sing praise, sing praise!
