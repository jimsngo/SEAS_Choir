Psalm 98:1, 2-3, 3-4
Francesca LaRosa
[Response]
The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.
[Verse 1]
Sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done wondrous deeds; his right hand has won victory for him, his holy arm.
[Verse 2]
The LORD has made his salvation known: in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.
He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel.
[Verse 3]
All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation by our God. Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands: break into song; sing praise.
