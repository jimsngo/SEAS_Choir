Psalm 23: 1-3, 3-4, 5, 6
Sarah Hart
[Response]
The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
[Verse 1]
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. In verdant pastures he gives me repose; beside restful waters he leads me; he refreshes my soul.
[Verse 2]
He guides me in right paths for his name’s sake. Even though I walk in the dark valley I fear no evil; for you are at my side with your rod and your staff that give me courage.
[Verse 3]
You spread the table before me in the sight of my foes; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
[Verse 4]
Only goodness and kindness follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for years to come.
