In the Breaking of the Bread
Timothy R. Smith
[Refrain]
In the breaking of the bread, we knew him, Lord Jesus. Alleluia! Alleluia!
[Verse 1]
Were not our hearts burning as he spoke? Were not our hearts yearning for the Word of God?
[Verse 2]
Put your hand here, see the place of nails. Blessed are those who have not seen, but believe.
[Verse 3]
Risen is Christ, he who died for us. Risen is Christ, shepherd who died for his flock.
[Verse 4]
Sing to the Lord, all you nations, praise. Great is our God, worthy to be praised.
[Verse 5]
Taste and see, see and behold God. Taste and see, see your God and believe.
[Verse 6]
I am the vine, you, the branches. Live in me, I in you, and bear much fruit.
[Verse 7]
Is not the cup, Christ outpoured, our God? One bread, one cup show our oneness in God.
