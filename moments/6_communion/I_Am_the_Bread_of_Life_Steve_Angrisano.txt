I Am the Bread of Life
Steve Angrisano/Tom Booth
[Verse 1]
I am the Bread of Life, I am the hope in night, I am the door wide open, I am the shepherd’s might, I am the truth and light, I am the way and life, I Am Who Am and I am for you: Come and follow me.
[Verse 2]
I am bread for the world, hope for the hopeless. Come to me,  and know that I’ll always be there with my arms open wide. I Am Who Am and I am for you: Come and follow me.
[Verse1 & Verse 2 together]
[Bridge]
I give my heart to those in sorrow, I come to those who are in need; hope for today and for tomorrow, light for all who want to see.
[Verse1 & Verse 2 together]
