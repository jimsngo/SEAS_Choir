Have Mercy, Son of David
Steve Angrisano/Curtis Stephan/Fr. Harry Hagan OSB
[Refrain]
Have mercy, Son of David! By mercy set us free. Have mercy, Son of David! Have mercy, have mercy.
[Verse 1]
Have mercy, Son of David! Give us your eyes to see that we may see the Kingdom in true simplicity.
[Verse 2]
For we, like Bartimeus, cry out with heart and soul. We ask for faith to follow, for faith to make us whole.
[Verse 3]
May we behold the glory, the majesty and grace of your mysterious beauty alive in every face.
