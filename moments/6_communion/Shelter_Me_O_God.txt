Shelter Me, O God
Bob Hurd
[Refrain]
Shelter me, O God, hide me in the shadow of your wings. You alone are my hope.
[Verse 1]
When my foes surround me, set me high above their reach. Hear when I call your name.
[Verse 2]
As a mother gathers her young beneath her care, gather me into your arms.
[Verse 3]
Though I walk in darkness, through the needle's eye of death, you will never leave my side.
