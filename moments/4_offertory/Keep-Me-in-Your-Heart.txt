Keep Me in Your Heart
Janèt Sullivan Whitaker
[Verse 1]
Jesus, hold me in peace; keep me in your heart.  Let me know your mercy; keep me in your heart.  Jesus, you are my hope. Help me when the darkness comes. In your kindness, keep me in your heart.
[Verse 2]
Jesus, you are my life; keep me in your heart. Fill me with your courage; keep me in your heart.  Sometimes sorrows will come. Jesus, you are always near. In my sadness, keep me in your heart.
[Verse 3]
Jesus, morning will come; keep me in your heart. Raise me with each new day; keep me in your heart. Jesus, teach me to love. Faithful let me always be, ’cause you love me. Keep me in your heart.
