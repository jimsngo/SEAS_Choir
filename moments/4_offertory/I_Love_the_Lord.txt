I Love the Lord
Paul Inwood
[Verse 1]
I love the Lord who has heard my cry. I love the Lord, standing at my side. I love the Lord, always close to me. I love the Lord, love the Lord who saves and sets me free.
[Verse 2]
I seek the Lord through each night and day. I seek the Lord as I walk my way. I seek the Lord when the light seems gone. I seek the Lord, seek the Lord who calls me to go on.
[Verse 3]
I need the Lord more than I can tell. I need the Lord—this I know so well! I need the Lord, how I need the Lord! I need the Lord, need the Lord with love on me outpoured.
[Verse 4]
I praise the Lord, singing clear and strong. I praise the Lord, focus of my song. I praise the Lord, strengthening my voice. I praise the Lord, praise the Lord and rapt’rously rejoice!
