Loving and Forgiving
Scott Soper
[Refrain]
Loving and forgiving are you, O Lord; slow to anger, rich in kindness, loving and forgiving are you.
[Verse 1]
All my being, bless the Lord, bless the holy name of God. All my being, bless the Lord, remembâ€˜ring the goodness of God.
[Verse 2]
God forgives us all our sins, healing those who live in pain, saving us from final death, God fills us with goodness and love.
[Verse 3]
Good and gracious is the Lord, slow to anger, rich in love. God remembers not our sins; forgiving and loving is God.
[Verse 4]
As heaven soars above the earth, so great the love of God for us. As far as east is from the west, the Lord takes our sins from us.
